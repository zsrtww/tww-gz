Taka deserves a special thanks for starting the project, providing us with the entire framework ported over from [Twilight Princess' Practice Rom](https://tpgz.io). Without Taka's help, and the TPGZ project as a whole, this project would likely have never gotten off the ground. 

Special thanks to TrogWW, for the work he's done previously on earlier renditions of the practice rom, and for all the work he's done for the Wind Waker community.

Finally, thank you to the Wind Waker community being so awesome.
